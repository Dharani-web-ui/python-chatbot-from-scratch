# python-chatbot-from-scratch
A simple Python-based chatbot built from scratch using NLP basics
Mini Chatbot Project in Python with Source Code

A Python-based chatbot that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process user inputs and provide appropriate responses. This project demonstrates key steps in building a chatbot, including preprocessing text, training a neural network model, and designing interactive conversations.
Features

    Interactive and responsive chatbot for text-based inputs.
    Utilizes Bag of Words (BoW) for feature extraction.
    Customizable intents with responses provided in intents.json.
    Neural network model built with TensorFlow/Keras.
    Designed to be lightweight and easy to modify.

File Structure

    intents.json contains predefined patterns, tags, and responses for the chatbot.
    The .ipynb notebook file has the Python code implementing the chatbot with detailed explanations.
    README.md has the documentation for the project (this file).

Requirements

To run this project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

    tensorflow
    numpy
    nltk

You can install them using pip:

pip install tensorflow numpy nltk
Steps to Run the Project

    Mount Google Drive

Update the data_root variable to the correct path where intents.json is located in your Google Drive.

    Load Required Libraries

The necessary libraries such as nltk, numpy, and tensorflow are imported.

    Load the Dataset

The intents.json file is parsed to extract patterns, responses, and corresponding tags.

    Preprocess the Data

    Tokenize and lemmatize text.

    Create a Bag of Words (BoW) representation.

    One-hot encode class labels.

    Train the Neural Network

    A feedforward neural network with dropout is used.

    Train the model on the preprocessed data.

    Interact with the Chatbot

Use the chatbot in an interactive session. Type your queries, and the bot will respond based on the trained model.
Customization

To modify or extend the chatbot:

    Update intents.json with new patterns and responses.
    Retrain the model to include the changes.

How It Works

    Text Preprocessing

    Tokenizes user inputs and patterns from intents.json.
    Converts text into numerical features using BoW.

    Neural Network Training

    Trains a model on feature-label pairs.
    Predicts the most relevant tag for a given user query.

    Response Generation

    Matches the predicted tag to the appropriate response from intents.json.
